# Fake Product Identification System

## Project Description

The Fake Product Identification System is a blockchain-based solution to combat counterfeit products. It allows manufacturers to register products on the blockchain and enables anyone to verify the authenticity of a product using its serial number. This system ensures transparency, immutability, and trust throughout the supply chain.

## Project Vision
